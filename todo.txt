Grading Guide and TODO list.

Grade D:

There is a compiler warning in BlobStateMoving.cs. Fix it and explain (in a comment) what the problem was, and what effect it had on the game. DONE

GameController.score is currently a private variable with a public function (AddScore) to change score. Replace both of these things with a public property called "Score" in the GameController class. This property should have a private backing variable and the Set function should contain the code currently in AddScore. DONE

Grade C:
Replace the Quintic/Out easing function in BlobStateShrinking with a Quartic/Out easing function.

Bug: You can set the blob to "Shrinking" multiple times by clicking on it multiple times. Fix this bug so that the blob can't be set to Shrink while already in the Shrinking state. DONE

Grade B:
Add an extra state to the Blob state machine called BlobStateBlinking. In this state, the blob should blink on and off with a delay of half a second between blinks. This state should be entered after BlobStatePulsing. DONE

Override the Leave() function in BlobStateBlinking to add 1 point to the score every time a blob leaves the Blinking state. DONE


Grade A:

Implement the selection sort algorithm in the RemoveHighestBlobs() function in the GameController class. DONE

Find something else in the code that you could improve. Implement your improvement and leave a comment explaining your changes.

Note: If you can't get Git working and submit the assignment via NYU classes the highest grade available will be B.
